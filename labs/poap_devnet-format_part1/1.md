# Power On Auto Provisioning (POAP) on Nexus Switches Part 1 - Setting up POAP Infrastructure

POAP automates the process of device instantiation for Nexus switches. This includes system OS installation and initial configuration, upon first boot of Nexus switches when taking them out of the box and powering them up for the first time. In this lab, you will learn to set up a complete POAP infrastructure and use it to provision Nexus switches. For more details about POAP, please refer to the [POAP documentation.]( https://developer.cisco.com/site/nx-os/docs/automation/poap/index.gsp )

The lab is divided into two parts. In the first part (this lab), we will set up the server side components needed for the POAP process to work successfully on the Nexus switches. In the second part, we will initiate the POAP process on the devices and observe the automatic provisioning process.

## Objectives

 - Understand how the POAP process works
 - Understand the requirements for POAP
 - Set up external services required for POAP:
   - DHCP Server
   - TFTP Server
   - Configuration Server
 - Understand how the POAP Python script works that executes on the switch
 - Learn how to walk-through and execute POAP on Nexus switches

## Prerequisites

The lab makes the following assumptions:
 - The user has an understanding of DHCP, HTTP, and TFTP
 - The user has working knowledge of Python
 - The user has working knowledge of Ansible
 - The user has knowledge of nano or other Linux based text editors

 ## Preparing the Sandbox

 **STOP:** You should ensure that the [NXOS Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/1e9b57ff-9e64-4c68-93e5-f0f0a8c6f22c?diagramType=Topology) lab is reserved before starting as it takes a few minutes to get started!

**Important Reservation Note:**

> When reserving this lab, be sure to select "POAP Network Topology" for the **VIRL Simulation** option.

 This lab is designed to be run from the DevBox included in the Sandbox.  You will connect to the DevBox via SSH and execute the lab through the terminal.  The SSH session can be done using the Guacamole Web Console, or directly SSHing to the server.  

 > Note: Both options to connect require you are VPN'd to the Sandbox.

 ```bash
 $ ssh root@10.10.20.20

## Understanding the POAP Process

The Cisco Nexus Power On Auto Provisioning (POAP) feature allows the network administrator to bring a new _out-of-the-box_ Nexus switch up, with a desired operating system and configuration.  When a brand new Cisco Nexus switch boots for the first time (or after erasing its startup configuration), it starts the POAP process.

The first step on the POAP process involves the switch going through the DHCP discovery process.  Like any other device that supports DHCP, it receives an IP address from a DHCP server.  The DHCP server assigns the switch an IP address, either from a specific DHCP pool, or a pre-defined IP address (DHCP reservation) based on the MAC address.  In order for the POAP process to continue, the DHCP server must also be configured to set DHCP Option 150, which tells the switch the IP address of the TFTP Server and the name of the Python script found on the TFTP server, that will be used to provision the Nexus switch.

*Note: The DHCP server can be configured to use either the MAC Address of the interface or a "client-identifier". This identifier could be the Serial Number of the switch. For this option the DHCP server will need to support RFC 6842*

![POAP Flowchart](/posts/files/poap_devnet-format_part1/assets/images/POAP_flow.png)

The flowchart above illustrates the following steps that are part of the POAP process:

1. The switch is powered on, for the first time (or without a startup configuration) and kicks off the POAP process.

2. If the operator chooses to configure the switch manually, the process is interrupted.

3. The DHCP Process occurs on the switch in which it receives an IP address along with the IP address of the TFTP server and Python script name of which it'll download and execute from the TFTP server.

4. The switch downloads a script (Python, TCL) and executes it (after optionally comparing the MD5 Checksum to ensure integrity)

At a high level here is how our sample Python script (you can create a custom script that meets your requirements) works that gets executed on the Nexus switch:

5. The script essentially retrieves a unique ID of the switch using generic show commands (MAC address or Serial number as examples).  It uses this data in a HTTP or TFTP request it makes to the server that holds switch-specific configurations.  In the response, the server also notifies the switch of it's desired target operations system version.

6. The script then checks whether the current image on the device matches the intent it received from the server. If there was a difference, it downloads the desired image over TFTP and installs it.

7. Then, the desired configuration (specific for that switch) is downloaded and saved to the switch, but is **not** yet applied.

8. The switch reboots.

9. When the switch powers back up, it has the desired OS, and loads the desired configuration it had previously stored in Step 7.

10. The new configuration is saved into the NVRAM.

At this point the POAP process is complete and the device reboots one more time with the desired image and configuration.

We've seen what the high level POAP process is like--let's now take a deeper look into the components required in order to deploy and execute POAP.
